# helium-device-codesandbox-show


I think this is a public link to my original codesandbox of this repository. You will probably have to fork it.

https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/helium-device-codesandbox-show-r468g?file=%2F.codesandbox%2Ftasks.json%3A1%2C1-22%2C1

My public app for that link is 

https://r468g-8080.csb.app/


You probably have to fork the project and then grab a new URL.
