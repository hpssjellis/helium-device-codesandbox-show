# helium-device-codesandbox-show



Not sure if this works as a gitpod.  try

https://gitpod.io/#github.com/hpssjellis/helium-iot-codesandbox

I think this is a public link to my original codesandbox of this repository. You will probably have to fork it.

https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/helium-device-codesandbox-show-r468g?file=%2F.codesandbox%2Ftasks.json%3A1%2C1-22%2C1

My public app for that link is 

https://r468g-8080.csb.app/


You probably have to fork the project and then grab a new URL.



also could try this one    

https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/helium01-integration-forked-lrrn67?file=%2Fapp.js


with this url    
https://lrrn67-8080.csb.app
